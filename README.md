This is the *engine* for downloading, managing, tagging, reading manga
with native Anilist integration. A powerful wrapper around
anything that implements its `Provider` interface.

It's designed to be a backend for various frontends that 
can be built on top of it.
Such as a CLI, a web app, a mobile app, gRPC server, etc. *Anything!*
